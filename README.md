## AI-Generated Code Notice


This repository contains code and documentation generated primarily using AI tools (e.g., Claude by Anthropic). The project was created to explore the capabilities of large language models in end-to-end software development. While the overall direction and purpose were set by a human, most of the code was produced automatically, with minimal manual editing.

Users should treat this code as experimental and review it carefully before using it in production or security-sensitive contexts.
